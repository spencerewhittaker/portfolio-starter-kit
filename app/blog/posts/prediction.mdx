At this point, it's obvious that LLMs are ascendant. 
There's less clarity about exactly how they will be fully used by kids in the future, but at least for now schools are reeling from their implications re: schoolwork.


One (I think) underdiscussed element of LLMs is about how nice they are to you. 
A recent tweet I saw suggested that if you ask an LLM to guess your IQ, it usually guesses 135.


Assuming significant LLM usage among kids in the coming decades, 
there's an optimistic case to be made that the future has a technology-native corrective to the fact that social media often tells you that you are not enough.

Hopefully that can be true. Especially as it seems unlikely that trends of screen time among kids get reversed.

As for my actual prediction:
## As has been the case throughout all generations, the old-timers will complain about the youth. ##

## Just like it was bemoaned that millennials are soft because we were all given participation trophies growing up, there will be a rhyming complaint that the generation of AI-native youth are too soft because they are always being told how wonderful they are by LLMs. ##

For the record, this largely seems like a fine thing.
